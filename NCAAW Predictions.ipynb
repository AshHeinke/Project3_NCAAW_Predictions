    "\n",
    "This data includes game-by-game stats at a team level (free throws attempted, defensive rebounds, turnovers, etc.) for all regular season, conference tournament, and NCAA® tournament games since the 2009-10 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each season, the file includes all games played from DayNum 0 through 132. The \"Regular Season\" games are simply defined to be all games played on DayNum = 132 or earlier (DayNum = 132 is Selection Sunday, and there are always a few conference tournament finals actually played early in the day on Selection Sunday itself). Thus a game played on or before Selection Sunday will show up here whether it was a pre-season tournament, a non-conference game, a regular conference game, a conference tournament game, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the columns is described below, noting that a \"W\" or \"L\" refers to the winning or losing team:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Season': this is the year in which the final tournament occurs. For example, during the 2016 season, there were regular season games played between November 2015 and March 2016, and all of those games will show up with a Season of 2016.\n",
    "- 'DayNum': this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"DayZero\" date. For example, the first game was DayNum = 11, which means it occured 11 days into the season from day zero.\n",
    "- 'WTeamID': this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, whether the game was won by the home team or visiting team, or if it was a neutral-site game.\n",
    "- 'WScore': this identifies the number of points scored by the winning team.\n",
    "- 'LTeamID': this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game.\n",
    "- 'LScore': this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team. Thus you can be confident that WScore will be greater than LScore for all games listed.\n",
    "- 'WLoc': this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting (or \"away\") team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". \n",
    "- 'NumOT': this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'WFGM': field goals made (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WFGA': field goals attempted (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WFGM3': three pointers made (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WFGA3': three pointers attempted (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WFTM': free throws made (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WFTA': free throws attempted (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WOR': offensive rebounds (pulled by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WDR': defensive rebounds (pulled by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WAst': assists (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WTO': turnovers committed (by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WStl': steals (accomplished by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WBlk': blocks (accomplished by the winning team)\n",
    "- 'WPF': personal fouls committed (by the winning team)\n",
    "\n",
    "*The same set of stats from the perspective of the losing team: LFGM is the number of field goals made by the losing team, and so on up to LPF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: by convention, \"field goals made\" (either WFGM or LFGM) refers to the total number of field goals made by a team, a combination of both two-point field goals and three-point field goals, however, \"three point field goals made\" (either WFGM3 or LFGM3) is just the three-point fields goals made. So to calculate two-point field goals, you have to subtract one from the other (e.g., WFGM - WFGM3). The total number of points scored is 2 * FGM + FGM3 + FTM."
